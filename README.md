# cmdfetch
Fetches system information for Linux and Windows machines. It's similar to screenfetch and neofetch, but is designed to include as many distros as possible.

View a list of working distros [here](https://github.com/hotlandsoftware/cmdfetch/wiki/Supported-distributions).

If your distro isn't on this list feel free to open an issue request requesting it.
