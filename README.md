<p align="center">A screenfetch/neofetch clone, it gathers information about your system from the command line.</p>

cmdfetch is a program designed to gather system information. Cmdfetch will display information about your OS, software, hardware, etc, in a nice convenient way.

# Why make a clone if both tools already are doing the job well?
The ultimate goal of this project isn't really to make a clone of just those two programs, it's also to port this program to every system and programming language imaginable.

Why? "Why not", is your answer. Also, because I'm kinda bored and thought it'd be cool. 

The software is still in its infancy and might not work correctly.
